        <div><h1>ABOUT</h1>
           <p>Hi! I’m Chrissy and I’m so excited to welcome you to The Clever Heart!</p>  

           <p>The Clever Heart is a blog dedicated to helping you create a healthy lifestyle you truly love.</p>  
            
           <p>After going to college for Health Science and Psychology, my entrepreneurial journey began as a personal trainer and I’ve been in the Health and Wellness industry ever since</p>
    
           <p>I’m always searching for the best products and ideas to help me live a healthy and fulfilling life. If you can do things to experience more confidence, energy, peace, bliss, etc – I am ALL about it. And the best part is – that most of these “things” are small and quite easy to implement but have HUGE results.</p>

            <p>I created this blog as a way of sharing the products, ideas, and tips that I find, use, enjoy, and follow. You see friends, family, and clients have always asked me for the best suggestions and I want to be able to share all those tips and finds with you here.</p>
            
            
            <p>It’s my opinion that to live a healthy lifestyle (especially one you love) requires creating balance. Exercise and eating healthy are part of living a healthy lifestyle – but are only a small piece of the equation.</p>
            
            <p>That’s why here on The Clever Heart I strive to include the best physical, mental, emotional, environmental, and social self care tips to help you create that balance.</p>

            <p>I invite you to follow along with me, ask questions, and if there’s a topic or product you want to know more about contact me here!</p>
